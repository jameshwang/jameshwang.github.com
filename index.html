        <h1>Chronicling of my daily lessons learned</h1>

<p>This site will chronicle my daily lessons learned to help improve my performance but also give me a sense of self worth and pride when looking back on what I've done.</p>

<h5>Jan 16th:</h5>

<p>Daily Tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>I started working on moving the logic that I built for the filtered errors report from the model to the script.</li>
</ul><p>Lessons Learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design - First from the controller, then model, and now to a background job script</li>
</ul><h5>Jan 17th:</h5>

<p>Daily Tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to tackle the check_subscription script which was painful.  I had to go into an old code base and figure out what it was doing and insert my logic in there.</li>
<li>I had to refactor it because the approach I took created excess code and inefficiencies.</li>
</ul><p>Lessons Learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to learn more about fixtures</li>
<li>I used debugger and I need to learn more about that</li>
<li>Iâ€™m getting used to git and github more and more</li>
</ul>
