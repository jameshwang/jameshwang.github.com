I had to go into an old code base and figure out what it was doing and insert my logic in there.\r\n* I had to refactor it because the approach I took created excess code and inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nLessons Learned:\r\n* I need to learn more about fixtures\r\n* I used debugger and I need to learn more about that\r\n* Iâ€™m getting used to git and github more and more\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
